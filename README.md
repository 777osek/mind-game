Everyone need to practice and train there mind to be more happy and greatful. If we do this we create and develop a more positive mind activity. It will increase our memory with more positive thinking, hopefully even smile and be more happy in general. 

For example; Greatful Mind Game is a site that hopes to help people practice and train there mind to both create and develop a more positive mind activity. This is a simple menory game (puzzel) that let you click on card that flipps and then shows different pictures, when two cards match you should find the next matching cards. When the whole game board is done it will start over again.

## Testing (Need to update)

I have used gitpod, github, and google devtools under my design and texting phases. Used git commands for saving and pushing the code from gitpod to github.

Under the testings I have only used google chrome as webbrowser.

Problems or issues under the design and testing have been a lot. because I am just in my begining to become a full stack coder. Basic typing errors, used wrong tags, elements, attributes etc. I have used code Institute as a baseline for information, slack community, w3school and YouTube for guidence. And also used my mentor for the code institute for support and guidence.

### Validator Testing (Need to update)

### Unfixed Bugs (Need to update)

(Need to update) You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment (Need to update)

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 

You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.
