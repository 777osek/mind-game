            <h2>How the Grateful Mind Game works</h2>
            <p>It works like a normal memory game board, where the card has one side as general for all cards. On the other side there is an image and your challenge are to find a matching pair.
                This is done by clicking on one of the cards on the memory game board, then click on another card. If they match they will stay opened as a matching pair. If they don't match they will flip back
                 and you can start clicking on one new card. And then remember if you have already clicked (opened) a equal card, if so click on that card so you get another matching pair.
                 Keep doing this until you have found all matching pairs or if you have used all of your total moves. In both cases the memory game will restart after a screen message has popped up and you clicked OK.
